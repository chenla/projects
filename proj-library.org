** Scope


BMF was originally meant to be a platform for creating very long term
digital library collections.

We propose to build an prototype electronic library system for PNCA
which will serve as a pilot for all school, public and national
archives and libraries.

The goals are as follows:

Establsh a digitization system for all forms of recorded media
including books, photos, artwork (both visual 2D and 3D art such as
stone sculptures) audio and video recordings.
