* Introduction

I was told when I was young that the ground temperature is
always around 55F if you were more than 2M underground
everywhere on earth.  This turns out to be very untrue.

The bad news is that in the tropics, air, earth and water
temperatures all achieve an equilibrium.

However, if we can develop a passive means of removing
humidity from humid air before being passed through
evaporative media then we would have an effective system.

This is a big if -- there are a number of ways to remove
humidity but they all require a lot energy and increase the
temperature.


However, geothermal systems do work if you dig very deep and
use water for heat exchange.
