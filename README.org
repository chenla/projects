Projects are specific funded and staffed attempts to build instances
of things that have been developed in the /deploy/ stage which is
illustrated in the following development entity diagram:

#+begin_src ascii 
   civilization (concept)
       |
       `--> primer (expression)
               |
               `--> deploy (manifestation)
                      |
                      `--> project (instance)
#+end_src

After a project has successfully completed, when possible, it will be
spun off as a /shop/, which means that it has now gone into practice
or production as an implemented part of the /primer/ under the
guidance of a /guild/, which might be expressed in the following
/practice/ enity diagram:

#+begin_src ascii 
   civilization (concept)
       |
       `--> primer (expression)
               |
               `--> guild (manifestation)
                      |
                      `--> practice (instance)
#+end_src
