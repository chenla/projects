Man have been making bells for at least five thousand years,
and metal bells four thousand -- about half of the age of
human civilization. There is something primal about bells,
they feel organic and natural, they are a tool to
communicate -- to call people to gather, or warn of danger.
Bells mark time, and ward off evil and announce the presence
of benevolent sprits.  They are part of marking events from
weddings to the winter Solstice and ushing out the dead.

Bells are musical instruments and magical devices.

And the wonderful thing about foundries is not only that the
technlogy is ancient, but it is cheap and degrades well, no
propane? use charcoal..

Solari paid the bills and supported construction of
Arcosanti by selling windbells.  At present they sell some
39,000 bells a year at prices ranging from US$50-250 or
more.

Notes:

  - use Silicon carbide crucibles
  - twin furnaces, each able to melt about 80-90 lbs of
    bronze per pouring
  - 2 pourings per weekday
  - average 50 bells per pouring
  - 11 person crew
  - bells are dipped in a vat of muriatic acid for less than
    an hour, and then rinsed and placed in a humidified tub
    overnight which gives a green patina.
  - fine sand called nickel slag used
  - a blowtorch is used to create additional colors
  - they have about 38 different bell patterns
  - the flask holds the block of sand together, which they
    call a snapflask, because it can be snapped together
    from two pieces
  - bronze melts at 1700F but they heat to 2200F which gives
    them a longer time to pour before the metal cools
  - foundry tongs -- 2-man lifting tongs & crucible tongs
  - the aluminum patterns are on plate --
  - they have a pneumatic press contraption on wheels
  - an agitator is used (part of the press?) to compact the sand
