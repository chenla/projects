We have been making bells for at least five thousand years, and metal
bells four thousand -- about have of the age of human
civilization. There is something primal about bells, they feel organic
and natural, they are a tool to communicate -- to call people to
gather, or warn of danger.  Bells mark time, and ward off evil and
announce the presence of benevolent sprits.  They are part of marking
events from weddings to the winter Solstice and ushing out the dead.

Bells are musical instruments and magical devices.

And the wonderful thing about foundries is not only the technlogy is
ancient, but it is cheap and degrades easily.
