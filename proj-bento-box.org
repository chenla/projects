It would be interesting if we came up with a standard shop container,
that would work like /unit load devices/ for air cargo.  An hour
before a market opens, a tractor with trailors goes through the market
and wheels off each shops's container. Then an hour after closing the
containers are collected, and the containers for the next market are
rolled in.  It would make it easier for seasonal sellers to be able to
participate along side regular daily stalls.

Containers can be refrigerated as well as set up to keep live seafood
overnight.

Use these containers as a foundation for everything -- supply chain --
do local processing, load it into a container and it get's picked up,
and passed around link Bombay tiffin boxes -- then get processed more,
then get split up to other containers which are sent to other
locations and processed more. Containers keep getting split up and
repacked into other containers which are sent forward towards their
destination.

Some end up in other shops who process further -- others end up in big
city markets -- and then final products which are delivered to a
location to be picked up or sent on to final delivery.  Eventually the
whole thing is done autonomously as a physical manifestion of the
market.

You don't call for a pickup, the network knows the progress of what
you are doing and you seal a container and put it out for pickup like
empty milk bottles for the milkman in the morning.

but it's the same principle -- pick something up, see where it is
going and drop it off at the nearest point towards it's destination
where it is picked up again and again until it reaches its
destination.

This is the opposite of the FedEx or Amazon model because it cuts out
the distribution centers -- the network becomes the distribution
center and everything is far more efficient.

This is not for any one company -- it is part of the public
infrastructure.


** what and where

If this is going to be a system that can be used globally....

I like the the bicon, tricons and quadcons -- but they should be
reserved for transport outside of a bioregion.  We need something more
lightweight that can be used within a bioregion that is closer to the
aluminum aircraft containers.

I like the rolldown for quadcons, this would be ideal for markets.

But we still need to work out about very small shipments, daily
shipments and how to deal with local routing.  Anything long distance
is relatively easy if we can repack containers easily -- and this
seems to all come down to robots.  If the network can think 20 steps
ahead of everything -- and repacking is all planned out before it is
even picked up....



* Bento Box System

There is an urban legand that ARPANET, which eventually became the
Internet, was originally designed to be resistent to nuclear attack.
Large parts of the Internet could be knocked out and the rest of the
Internet would continue to operate.

Even if this were true, if large parts of the Internet were to go
dark, any content on servers in those areas would also be cut off as
well.  Any large scale Internet failures would have global impact
because centralized cloud and mobile phone applications, now store the
majority of people's personal information and media, including email,
contact lists, maps, documents, spread sheets, photos, music and
video.

This breaks the principle of =graceful degradation=, which requires that:

   - there is no single point of failure,
   - failed components are isolated,
   - propagation is prevented by containment,
   - that content or service can revert to more primitive versions.

This holds true not only for individual machines, but software, and
even content like a document.  For example, if a formated, document
that includes embedded media fails to render properly, you should
still be able to view the document as plain text.

Put simply this is accomplished through redundancy and duplication.  


** Containing Collapse

If you can't prevent a failure or collapse, the system should be
designed to be able to ensure that the failure is localized as much
as possible.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Thailand_floods][2011 Bangkok Floods]] directly effected 66 out of 77 provinces in
Thailand, but because 90% of all goods distributed throughout the
country passed through a logistics system based in Bangkok, the
floods resulted in food and goods shortages throughout the entire
country for nearly a year. This logistics failure in turn made it
impossible for exporting goods to other countries that weren't
effected by the floods as well.  Because the logistics failure could
not be contained or routed around effected areas, the floods had a
larger ecomonic impact on Japan than the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

But this was no only a failure in logistics, it was also a failure in
redunancy and specialization.  Japanese automakers relied on Thai
factories more most of their electrical sub-assemblies.  Computer
makers around the world relied on Thai factories for producing hard
drives.  All of the production and knowledge of how to produce these
sub-assemblies and hard drives had been located in one location, so a
failure in one place effected the entire planet.

This is a problem waiting to happen in a large number of other
industries.  Flat screen production is now entirely controlled by a
few small areas in China.  *[ need more examples ]*  Apple computer
has admited that they could not produce their products outside of
China because there was no longer anywhere else who had the
knowledge, experience and production facilities.

* What Are Bento Boxen

*Bento Boxen* refer to two open-source hardware designs, a design for
deploying very efficient, and inexpensive modular data centers that
bring computing power to the edge of networks and emerging markets.

These modular designs, adapt OpenCompute open-source server, power and
rack designs which are designed for very large scale deployment of
tens of thousands of servers in a single facility so that the same
efficiencies seen at scale can be used in a geographically
distributed network.

Bento Boxen are designed for use for Big Data and Cloud Services;
specifically the open source OpenStack Cloud Computing suite of
applications.

     [[./img/bento/openstack-opencompute.png]]

** Advantages

   - Energy consumption per unit of computing power has declined by
     38%.
   - A Fully loaded OpenCompute Rack requires a maximum of 12.6Kw, as
     compared to Off-the-Shelf Hardware requires 20Kw or more per
     rack. 
   - The new modular data center design is expected to have a PUE of
     1.06, well below the EPA-defined state-of-the-art industry
     average of 1.5. This means 93% of the energy from the grid makes
     it into every Open Compute server.
   - Centralized chillers have been replaced by an evaporative media
     cooling system with no moving parts, except pans, using outside
     air.
   - Elimination of traditional inline UPS systems and the elimination
     of a 480V to 208V transformation.
   - A "lights out" data center design that minimizes the costs of
     administration and maintenance.
   - Ethernet-powered LED lighting integrates lighting with server
     systems.
   - Optional integrated Battery Backup and control system.
   - Optional integrated FM-280 fire suppression system.
   - Low maintenance, because of very few moving parts.  There are
     only six fans, two motors to control vents, and a couple of
     valves.

* Computer Racks

The Open Rack v1.0 has three power zones in a single column rack. Each
power zone has 10xOpenU for servers and 3xOpenU for power shelf (1
OpenU = 48mm). Each power shelf has a 6+1 700W redundant PSU to
provide 4200W of continuous maximum load and three bus bars per power
zone. The total height for each 10xOpenU of server space is 480mm.

* Servers
** Motherboards

Present day, Shared-Nothing computing clusters, that power nearly all
cloud services are traditionally made up of lots of identical servers
which use commodity hardware.  Before this, it was thought that
commercial systems needed to use industrial grade commercial hardware
that was better made and had a lower failure rate.  However, in the
early 00's Google realised that industrial grade hardware was a much
as double the cost of commodity hardware, and the failure rate was
only 3-4% lower than commodity hardware.  The math was clear, it is
better to have cheap hardware that fails more often and design your
system to expect and work around failures automatically, than to
spend twice as much money to only get a system that was only a few
percent more reliable.

The drawback to this approach is that motherboards also come with a
lot of extra "goop" that is not needed, including things like
proprietary management features on HP and Dell motherboards for use
with their own server management system.  If you aren't using their
management software, these features cost more money, use electricity
in their own right and complicate things.  If you use commodity
consumer motherboards there are all sorts of things added that are
designed for gaming, or wireless, or bluetooth or HDMI, ports that
will never be needed in a headless server environment.

This added cruft creates needless complexity as, over time, there
will be no avoiding purchasing more than one model motherboard from
different vendors.

OpenCompute motherboards do not have built in Ethernet and use
standard 10GB PCI ethernet cards.

*** CPU and Memory

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/windmill-motherboard.png]]

The motherboard uses next generation Intel® Xeon® processor E5-2600
product family CPUs with a TDP (thermal design power) up to 115W. The
motherboard supports these features:

 - 2 Intel® Xeon® E5-2600 (LGA2011) series processors up to 115W
 - 2 full-width Intel QuickPath interconnect (QPI) links up to 8
   GT/s/direction
 - Up to 8 cores per CPU (up to 16 threads with Hyper-Threading
   Technology)
 - Up to 20 MB last level cache
 - Single Processor Mode
 - DDR3 direct attached memory support on cpu0 and cpu1 with:
 - 4 channel DDR3 registered memory interface on processors 0 and 1
 - 2 DDR3 slots per channel per processor (total of 16 DIMMs on the
   motherboard)
 - RDIMM/LV-RDIMM (1.5V/1.35V), LRDIMM and ECC
   UDIMM/LV-UDIMM(1.5V/1.35V)
 - Single, dual, and quad rank DIMMs
 - DDR3 speeds of 800/1066/1333/1600 MHz
 - Up to maximum 512 GB memory with 32GB RDIMM DIMMs

*** Future

Facebook is spearheading what they call a “Group Hug” board which will
provide a new common slot architecture specification for
motherboards. This specification can be used to produce boards that
are completely vendor-neutral and will last through multiple processor
generations.

The specification uses a simple PCIe x8 connector to link the SOCs to
the board.  AMD, Applied Micro, Calxeda, and Intel have all announced
support for the Group Hug board, and Applied Micro and Intel have
already built mechanical demos of their new designs.

This will make it possible to upgrade through multiple generations of
processors without having to replace the motherboards or the in-rack
networking.

** Windmill Server Design

The "Windmill" compute sled is based on a second-generation
opencompute motherboard design. It's a two-socket Intel motherboard in
a tube, which is known in Facebook as the 'sushi boat' form factor."
The compute sled is kept as as simple as possible; two processors, 16
DIMM slots for memory, and a few PCI slots. Facebook uses PCI
10-gigabit Ethernet cards instead of putting Ethernet directly on the
motherboard they can be purchased from multiple suppliers.

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/Winterfell.jpg]]

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/windmill-img.jpg]]


The design maximizes airflow.  A standard 1U-sized OEM server uses 28
watts of fan power to pull air through the impedance caused by that
plastic bezel, whereas the equivalent OpenCompute server uses just
three watts for that purpose.

The same chassis and motherboard is used to build a variety of
different servers.  Compute nodes don't require their own hard drives
and use only internal RAM.  Web servers require Hard Drives.

*** Storage Servers

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/windmill-storage.png]]

The Windmill sled is also used for high density storage nodes as
well.  A single sled can hold 15 3.5" drives, which, if using 4.5TB
drives could store as much as 2.8PB in a single rack!

In this way, racks can be configured to use any combination of
Compute, Web or Storage servers which all use the same compute sled.

* Bento Box
** Modular Mobile Data Centers

Modular data centers, housed in standard ISO 20" and 40" shipping
containers are nothing new.  SUN/Oracle, IBM, SGI (formally Rackable),
HP and a slew of others all have products on the market.  Many of
these products have excellent designs and, compared to the cost of
building a traditional brick and mortar data center, they are also
cost effective.  But that still does not make them cheap.

The 20" 6 rack Black Box from Sun/Oracle starts at USD250,000, empty.
The most inexpensive on the market is the SGI Ice Cube Air, which
holds 4 Racks, starts at USD$99,000.

We believe that if the same principles that went into the OpenCompute
designs, which focus on efficiency and lower operating costs, were
applied to modular data centers, that price point could be cut in
half.

The Bento Box, is a open hardware design based roughly on the ICE Cube
Air design and adapted for use with OpenCompute rack, power and
server designs.

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 15cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/icecube-ext.jpg]]


 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 15cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/icecube-plan.png]]



The layout is simple.  Air is brought in from one end of the
container through louvered vents through an data center grade air
filters and into a multi-stage evaporative media cooling system, that
has not moving parts aside from a remote controlled valve that
controls water flow.

Water is brought into the container using a standard garden hose that
can provide 2 gallons of water a minute.  Air is pulled through the
evaporative media by six variable speed high speed fans which then
passes into the cool isle of the server section of the container.

Cool air then passes through 4 racks, and then into a hot isle and
from there out of the container.

** Cooling System

Evaporative cooling, also known as a 'swamp cooler' is an ancient
means of cooling air.  Warm air is passed through a veil of water.
The hot air evaporates the water, and is cooled.  Evaporation depends
on the surface area of the water.  So the smaller the water droplet
is, the more evaporation takes place.

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 15cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/myst.png]]

A common approach is to atomize water into a myst and hot hair is
passed is passed through, completely evaporating the water and
cooling the air.

The problem with this approach is that water has to be very clean, so
that impurities don't clog the misting nozzles.  This is typically
done by passing the water through a reverse-osmosis filtration
system.  The system also requires pumps and other moving parts.


 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/evap-media.png]]


An alternate approach is to use evaporative media, which is a porous
material that holds water and breaks it down into very small diameter
droplets.  Air passed through the media and the droplets evaporate
and cool the air.

The system has the advantage of not requiring water filtration, or
pumps or even nozzles that can easily clog up.  A new generation of
evaporative media like GLASDek is resistent to bacteria, and can be
scrubbed to remove water impurities that clog the media.

SGI developed their own proprietary 4-Stage evaporative media cooling
system.  We believe that designing our own multi-stage system will be
our greatest challenge.

** Electrical Systems

A great deal of electricity is wasted in traditional data centers.
Most data centers convert power three or four times; from 480 to 208,
into a UPS, back out of the UPS, into a power distribution unite, and
into a server power supply.

Every time you step down power you loose two to five percent, if you
are doing this three to four times, that translates into as much as
20% of power usage.

In addition to the loss of power, the transformers the doing the
stepping down produce heat as well, which requires additional cooling.

To address this problem, OpenCompute specifies that unregulated 480
volt is brought directly to the racks.  Each rack will have three
power shelves which is converted once into 12 volt power connection
in the back.  Individual servers do not have their own power supply,
everything is drawn directly from the power shelf.

Power supplies in servers, not only generate heat, they also take up
space in the server and reduce air flow, increasing the amount of
cooling required as well.

This approach cuts the amount of electricity required to a rack
dramatically.  A fully loaded rack using traditional off-the-shelf IT
1RU hardware requires up to 20Kw or more.  The equivalent fully loaded
OpenCompute rack requires a maximum of 12,600Kw.

The SGI Ice Cube Air, four rack modular data center is designed to
provide cooling for more than 140Kw.  A four rack OpenCompute
configuration would require less than51Kw.
** Battery Backup System

OpenCompute has designed their own Battery Backup System that is
meant to work best with Open-Rack and OPC server hardware.


 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/opc-battery.png]]


The specification focuses on the electrical and control part of the
backup system, and uses industry standard batteries that can be
purchased from a wide number of vendors.

The batteries required to backup four Open-Racks would occupy nearly a
full rack.  Battery systems can operate at a wider temperature range
than servers, ranging from 30-45C or even hotter.  So typically,
battery systems are sealed, with only small holes for air flow, when
they are located side-by-side server racks.  Since there is no need to
keep battery systems at the same temperature, they are often located
in separate rooms from server racks.

Since there are only four racks in a Bento Box, it would not be
effcient to use one of them for battery backup systems.  However,
since the Bento Box is longer than the Ice Cube Air, there is enough
space between the evaporative cooling unit and the wall of fans to
include the battery system.  

There are a number of ways this can be done, which will be part of
the design process.

** Network Operations Control Software

The Bento Box is a 'lights out' data center which is designed to be
managed remotely and require minimal maintanence.

OpenCompute has a specification for a hardware management software
system which controls booting and restarting servers, monitoring
temperature, humidity, electrical usage, network traffic etc.

Bento will expand on this specification to include monitoring and
management of the evaporative cooling system, electrical systems,
battery backup, fire supression etc.

The system is designed to monitor and manage multiple Bento and
Tiffin Boxes that are spread out over a wide geographic area and
designed to work as a wide-area distributed cloud network.  The
management system will be critical not only in managing individual
boxen, but in managing them as a single network as well.

** Fire Supression 

A FM-200 (Halon replacement gas) fire suppression system will be
included in each Bento Box.  The system can be triggered
automatically, as well as remotely using the Hardware Management
software system.

** Diesel Backup System

Each Bento Box should have a 60Kw backup diesel generator on site,
together with enough diesel fuel to run the generator for a minimum
of 24-36 hours.

The generator must be able to start up in 30 seconds or less, since
battery backup will last at most 60-90 seconds at full load.

Contracts with local fuel suppliers should already be in place locally
to refuel the generator daily in the case of extended power outages.


** Water Supply Backup Systems

A water tank that will hold 24 hours worth (2,000 gallons) of water at
maximum load should be in plcae locally.

Contracts with a local company with a water truck should already be
in place locally to refill the water tank in the event of an extended
water supply outage.

* Tiffin Box

The *Tiffin Box* is a design for a one third rack, 18RU, 14 server
Deskside compute cluster running on 208V.  With an enclosure that
minimizes noise.  The Tiffin Box is essentially a 1/3 Open Rack
design, that will hold standard Windmill server sleds.

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/Mobi-Rack.png]]

The system will be similar in size to SGI's MOBI Rack system, and can
be housed in a variety of different configurations, including a rack
mount enclosure, a portable enclosure that can be shipped, and a
deskside enclosure with sound dampening suitable for use in a
laboratory, office or equipment closet.

 #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm :center 
     [[./img/bento/third-rack.png]]




The Tiffin Box will be cooled, by four large, variable-speed fans at
the back, and a Air Filter on a door on the front.

The Tiffin Box is designed to run the same OpenStack software
infrastructure and be managed remotely by the same Hardware
Management system that is used for the Bento Box.

The Tiffin Box is designed to run either as a stand alone compute
cluster, or as part of a larger distributed network that is made up
of Bento Boxes and other Tiffin Boxes.

* Road Map

Development of Bento Boxen designs will be broken down into multiple
stages:

** Adapt Four Standard 19" Racks

Four standard 19" racks will be modified to house OpenCompute hardware.
Facebook has detailed in a whitepaper how they did this for one of
the first deployments of OPC hardware in one of their existing data
centers.

** Build 14 Windmill Servers

Motherboards for Windmill servers can be purchased from Quanta
Computer.  Server shelves, and compute sled enclosures can be
fabricated to order by a company in Vienam which can accept CAD
drawings.

** Install OpenStack Software into New Servers

The 14 new servers will serve as a development system for building
the first OpenStack Cloud Service in Phnom Penh.

Once this system is complete, a software development team will begin
work on building the Web Site and GUI to the Cloud Service, and begin
work on adapting the OPC HW Management Spec for managing Bento and
Tiffin Boxes.

** Procure A 20" Shipping Container and move to Bivet

A 20" shipping container will be purchased, the doors removed, two
side openings for doors cut into the sides.  Next the container will
be stripped down to bare metal and painted before delivery to the
factory space in Bivet.

** Develop Filters, Cooling & Fans

Two consultants will be hired to help design the electrical and
cooling systems for the Bento Box.

This will require purchae of six high-speed fans, airfilters,
evaporative media and circuit breakers, wiring etc for the electrical
systems.

** Install Racks

The modified racks will be installed in the Bento Box and sensors
installed and the cooling system will be tested with live servers
running in the box.

** Battery, Fire Supression & Security

The Battery Backup system, which will use an off-the-shelf that will
fit in the same enclosure as the OPC design will be installed.

A company in Vietnam which specializes in Security and F-200 fire
supression systems will be hired as consultants to design the fire
supression system and provide the API for it to be connected to the
hardware management systems.
