* Introduction

Evaporative cooling works very well, but only if air humidity is below
a certain level.  This means that earth-cooling pipes are not a viable
means of providing effective cooling.

SGI solved this problem in their ICE Cube containerized systems by
recycling hot dry air coming from the servers, and mixing it with
outside air to dry it and achieve a cooling effect.
