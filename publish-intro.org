In publishing there are monographs, reference works and
serials.

On the Web there are web pages, blogs, wikis, and posts.

A post is simular to an article that you would see in a
magazine or newspaper.  There are some reference works in
the form of wikis (wikipedia stands out) and there is a
great deal of documentaion in the form of hierarchically
structured texts simular to books.

But the more you look at the web, electronic monographs,
especially book length monographs are the exception.  The
web is not an electronic library, it is something else.
There is nothing wrong with this but there are institutional
roles that monographs and journals play that the Web is not
meeting.
